CSE330S SP2020: Creative Final Project - Simple "Social Media" Site.

Extra creative features:

    1) An "animation and neat things" overload for visual appeal:
        a) Clock that displays real time.
        b) Bubbles in the login/registration page background.
        c) Load bar for submitting posts.
        d) Cool welcome text at login/register page to welcome users.

    2) Ability to change (and save) the theme of the user's dashboard (a backend feature).

    3) Ability to follow users and view their posts in your feed (a backend feature).

    4) A Kanye West quote generator that pulls from an external API, displaying quotes in a closable/openable box in the bottom right corner.

    5) Besides login and register, the server will not allow for any requests unless there is a session associated with the user currently running; if you go to localhost:3001, you will get an error message saying that you are not allowed to do so, unless you hit /register or /login (NOTE: you must be logged out of the site). 
    Even if you do hit /register or /login, it must be a post request (a backend feature.)

    6) Users like/dislike the posts of users they follow, as well as their own posts. (a backend feature)

Creative Portion:
1. Calendar Theme: User can change the theme of the calendar and store the preference in the database. Each browser the user signs in on will show the same theme for them. Users can only change the theme when logged in. See the "Choose a theme" section on the bottom of the page.

2. Events List: User can view all the events ordered by date in a side pannel list view. The user can click on the events displayed here and interact in the same way as clicking on the event in the calendar. To use this feature, click the "Events" button on the top to open the sidebar. To close the sidebar, click "Events" button again.

3. Share Event: User can share events with another user. The user must be in the database. Events shared with the user populate both the calendar and sidebar. Events that have been shared with the user are displayed in a different color. Additionally, users cannot edit, delete, or share files that have been shared with them. Only the original file owner can do so.

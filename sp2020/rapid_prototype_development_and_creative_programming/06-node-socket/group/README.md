Creative Portion:

    1) "Chat Roulette" feature that allows user to be "paired" with another user in the current room, at random. Sort of a "random pen-pal" idea. Can just send a message and potentially make a new friend in quarantine.

    2) Nifty styling features: a loading bar for "send" buttons (sending a message of any type) and a slider to change the size of the entire page for better (or worse) readability (concerns text size that is dynamically changed using slider). All three types of messaging and the send bar are in a box on the bottom of the page at all times.

    3) Added a bot that provides information and help depending on what you type into the input box for sending a message to the entire room. Example commands: /help, /who, and /features. /help shows the previous commands, /who shows room's admin, and /features gives an overview of everything on the chatroom. The bot will also output a message when a user has been kicked or banned from a chat.

They are having a major problem with customer retention in their wireless business. In the mid-Atlantic region, 20% of cell phone customers leave when their contracts expire, and it is getting increasingly difficult to acquire new customers. Since the cell phone market is now saturated, the huge growth in the wireless market has tapered off. Communications companies are now engaged in battles to attract each other‚Äôs customers while retaining their own. Customers switching from one company to another is called churn, and it is expensive all around: one company must spend on incentives to attract a customer while another company loses revenue when the customer departs.\n",
    "You have been called in to help understand the problem and to devise a solution. Attracting new customers is much more expensive than retaining existing ones, so a good deal of marketing budget is allocated to prevent churn. Marketing has already designed a special retention offer. Your task is to devise a precise, step-by-step plan for how the data science team should use MegaTelCo‚Äôs vast data resources to decide which customers should be offered the special retention deal prior to the expiration of their contracts.*\n",

For this task, I would look at the duration each customer has been with MegaTelCo. I believe customers who have been around for a long time (longer contracts) need less incentive to stick around; they are likely comfortable. Focusing on customers who have shorter contracts is one aspect. Another is to collect data on their service locations and other service providers in the area. Customers who have only MegaTelCo as their option don't need added incentive, this is their only option. Resources should be allocated on customers with shorter contracts and on customers with many options (lots of competition)."

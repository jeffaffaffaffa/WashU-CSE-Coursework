    "From the above results, version 2 of cse217 performs quite a bit better than v1 in all aspects. This is likely due to the immense difference in the number of parameters between the two models. I don't think we can be happy with this because even with the better model, it is only getting the right prediction about half of the time. This is analogous to flipping a coin to determine yes or no for each image; not good. I would suggest adding more parameters to increase the accuracies of both. Additionally, adding augemented images to train both (which is actually what will happen) and/or increasing the amount of data used to train the model will help, as many images are wildly different in composure, even if the hands themselves look relatively the same. Increasing the model's \"experience\" will be beneficial."

    "\n",
    "It works well when there aren't things that look like fingers in the fist area. When a fist was made for \"rock,\" it was very commonly mistaken for paper, where the palm is open with fingers outstretched. It was also pretty common for scissors to be mistaken for rock. This is likely because the scissors form with the hand is still \"semi-rock\"-like with three fingers closed in. In general, it seems that it was quite easy for everything to be mixed up. I think it is all likely because of having fingers clearly visibile, which can cause confusion between the shapes (in my particular pictures since my hand was always oriented with the palm facing the camera).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a bit hard to say but it also (generally) appears to work better with a more distinctly colored background. For some of my testing images, wall color was similar to my hand color. The model never predicited those correctly and assigned very similar probabilities to all classes, where the final prediction was only a tiny bit higher in probability than the others. The other backgrounds resulted in more drastic probability differences, though most of those were predicted incorrectly as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also feel like my hand was a little too close to the camera for most of the shots. In some of the correctly predicted ones, I noticed that my hand was a little bit further away. The difference this makes is hard to tell with only 15 samples, but could be a factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can't comment much on angle besides the fact that every picture, I had my \"palm\" facing the camera. Not sure if it would have made a difference if I had rotated my hand around. However, from my analysis in the first paragraph of this box, I do think having all fingers shown messes up the model. So there is likely some truth in saying that rotating the hand the other way to make the \"palm area\" less \"messy\" could help with prediction accuracy. This way, the fingers that distinguish rock, paper, and scissors from each other can be more prominent. Following this, the model could be skewed from training, because of a lack of \"palm facing camera\" shots, and be predominantly looking for 2 fingers for scissors, 5 fingers for paper, and none for rock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it works better when the background is more different in color than the hand, when there are less fingers in the pose/palm is angled away from the camera; less fingers in the shot, and when it is a little bit further away (approx. 2 feet I'd say).\n",

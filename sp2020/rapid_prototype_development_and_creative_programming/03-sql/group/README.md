Creative Portion:
1. Dashboard: The user can visit the dashboard to view and update their information. The main page of dashboard lists all the stories and comments they have written. There are links to the stories they've written as well as to the stories on which they've written comments. This page also previews the comments. If the comment is over a certain length, it will truncate the preview and append "...". The user can also update their username and/or password. In order to do so, they must re-insert their username and password to validate that it is them. Once they have been verfied, they can enter a new username, or enter a new password. If entering a new password, they must insert the same password twice.
2. Search Feature: The user can search for key words either for a title or username. The key words are compared separately.
3. Next/Previous Page: The website limits the number articles to 10 per page. The user can go to next and previous pages to get the other articles.

w3 validator was down, so we instead had to use:
for HTML: https://html5.validator.nu
